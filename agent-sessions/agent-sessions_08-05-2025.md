```

### Component Library Structure
1. **Authentication & Authorization** - Login forms, OAuth, 2FA, RBAC
2. **Navigation & Layout** - Navbars, sidebars, breadcrumbs, footers
3. **Data Display** - Tables, grids, lists, timelines, kanban boards
4. **Forms & Input** - Multi-step forms, builders, surveys, checkouts
5. **Dashboard & Analytics** - Charts, metrics, calendars, maps
6. **E-commerce** - Product cards, carts, galleries, reviews
7. **Communication** - Chat, comments, notifications, messaging
8. **User Management** - Profiles, settings, directories, teams
9. **Search & Discovery** - Global search, filters, faceted search
10. **Mobile-First** - Bottom nav, drawers, action sheets
11. **UI Elements** - Modals, toasts, carousels, accordions
12. **Admin & Management** - CRUD interfaces, logs, settings
13. **Integrations** - Payments, analytics, email, storage
14. **Security & Compliance** - CAPTCHA, consent, audit logs

### Database Schema Updates
- `component_categories` - Component groupings
- `component_library` - Individual components with metadata
- `feature_templates` - Pre-configured component bundles
- `component_relationships` - Dependencies and recommendations

## Team Status Summary

### Manager Assistant
- Successfully coordinated assistant prompt creation
- Designed comprehensive component library structure
- Facilitated team alignment on project architecture
- Next: Monitor implementation progress

### Developer Assistant (includes Audio)
- Ready to implement component fetching functionality
- Prepared for audio recording integration
- Has clear TypeScript interfaces and React hooks
- Next: Build component sidebar UI

### Database Assistant
- Received comprehensive seed data instructions
- Has SQL implementation ready for execution
- Clear schema design for component library
- Next: Execute seed data population

### Audit Assistant
- Completed comprehensive security audit (B+ grade)
- Identified critical authentication and accessibility issues
- Provided clear action items for improvement
- Next: Monitor fix implementation

## Critical Action Items

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Database**: Execute component library seed data
2. **Developer**: Implement component fetching service
3. **Security**: Fix middleware-level route protection
4. **Accessibility**: Add keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop

### Next Sprint Goals
1. Complete component library UI implementation
2. Integrate audio recording with component system
3. Test drag-and-drop functionality with seeded components
4. Address audit findings (security & accessibility)

## Technical Decisions Made

1. **Consolidated Audio Role**: Audio Assistant responsibilities merged into Developer Assistant for better integration
2. **Component Structure**: Adopted category-based organization with complexity scoring
3. **Relationships**: Implemented three types - requires, recommends, incompatible
4. **Feature Templates**: Created starter kits for common use cases
5. **Status Updates**: All assistants must update their status files each session

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **Security**: Missing middleware protection (Critical)
2. **Accessibility**: Low WCAG compliance (45%)
3. **Performance**: Bundle optimization needed
4. **Integration**: Component relationships complexity

### Mitigation Strategies
1. Implement middleware protection immediately
2. Create accessibility improvement roadmap
3. Add performance monitoring
4. Test component dependencies thoroughly

## Next Session Plans

1. Review database seed execution results
2. Test component library fetching implementation
3. Begin drag-and-drop integration
4. Address critical security findings
5. Plan audio recording UI integration

## Metrics & Progress

- **Prompts Created**: 11 (initial + session prompts)
- **Component Categories**: 14 defined
- **Components Designed**: 50+ with configurations
- **Feature Templates**: 3 starter kits
- **Documentation Pages**: 6 new guides created
- **Security Score**: B+ (needs critical fixes)
- **Accessibility Score**: 45% (needs improvement)

## Session Notes

The project has evolved from initial concept to a well-structured implementation plan. The component library design provides a solid foundation for the Visual Prompt Builder's drag-and-drop functionality. With clear assistant roles and comprehensive documentation, the team is positioned for efficient development.

Key success: Consolidating the Audio Assistant role into Developer Assistant simplifies the team structure while maintaining all functionality. The component library seed data provides immediate value for users.
