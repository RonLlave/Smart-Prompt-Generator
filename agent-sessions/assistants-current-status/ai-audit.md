# AI Audit Assistant - Current Status

## Last Updated: August 4, 2025

### Current Tasks
- [x] Initial project audit completed
- [x] Security baseline assessment completed
- [x] Code quality metrics analysis completed
- [x] Performance assessment completed
- [x] Accessibility compliance evaluation completed

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Comprehensive security audit (B+ grade)
- ✅ Code quality analysis (B+ grade) 
- ✅ TypeScript usage review
- ✅ Authentication/authorization assessment
- ✅ API security validation
- ✅ Performance and bundle analysis
- ✅ Accessibility compliance audit (45% WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Audit Findings

#### Critical Issues
🔴 **SECURITY**: Missing middleware-level route protection for dashboard routes
🔴 **ACCESSIBILITY**: No keyboard alternatives for drag-and-drop functionality
🔴 **ACCESSIBILITY**: Form labels not properly associated with controls

#### High Priority Issues
🟠 **SECURITY**: Supabase database adapter disabled in NextAuth config
🟠 **CODE QUALITY**: Missing error boundaries in React component tree
🟠 **ACCESSIBILITY**: Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements
🟠 **ACCESSIBILITY**: Color contrast ratios need verification

#### Medium Priority Issues
🟡 **SECURITY**: No explicit CSRF protection for sensitive operations
🟡 **CODE QUALITY**: Unknown types used instead of specific unions
🟡 **PERFORMANCE**: Missing loading states in components
🟡 **ACCESSIBILITY**: Missing semantic HTML structure (nav, main landmarks)

#### Low Priority Issues
🟢 **CODE QUALITY**: Magic numbers need extraction to constants
🟢 **PERFORMANCE**: Consider code splitting and lazy loading
🟢 **ACCESSIBILITY**: Add skip navigation links

### Security Status
- **Authentication**: ✅ Good (NextAuth + OAuth)
- **Authorization**: ⚠️ Client-side only (needs middleware protection)
- **Input validation**: ✅ Excellent (Zod + next-safe-action)
- **API security**: ✅ Excellent (proper validation & auth checks)
- **Database security**: ✅ Excellent (RLS + comprehensive policies)
- **Dependencies**: ✅ No vulnerabilities detected

### Quality Metrics
- **Overall Security Score**: B+ (Good with critical auth fix needed)
- **Code Quality Score**: B+ (Strong TypeScript usage, good architecture)
- **TypeScript Compliance**: Good (strict mode enabled, minimal any usage)
- **Accessibility Score**: 45% WCAG 2.1 AA (Needs significant improvement)
- **ESLint Issues**: 4 warnings (3 any usage, 1 unused import)

### Performance Analysis
- **TypeScript**: ✅ Compiles without errors
- **Bundle**: Optimization pending (build has minor type assertion issue)
- **Dependencies**: Modern versions with good performance characteristics
- **Architecture**: Well-structured with proper separation of concerns

### Immediate Action Required
1. **CRITICAL**: Implement middleware-based route protection
2. **CRITICAL**: Add keyboard navigation for drag-and-drop
3. **CRITICAL**: Fix form accessibility issues
4. **HIGH**: Enable Supabase adapter in NextAuth
5. **HIGH**: Add error boundaries to component tree

### Next Priorities
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix audio recording database schema mismatch 
2. Address critical security and accessibility issues
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Add missing ARIA labels and semantic HTML
5. Set up color contrast testing
6. Add performance monitoring

### Recent Audio Recording Audit (August 5, 2025)
🔴 **CRITICAL DATA INTEGRITY ISSUE**: Audio recording feature has a major schema mismatch that prevents data insertion

**Root Cause**: 
- Code expects `audio_transcript` table (lines 82-86 in `audio-recordings.ts:82-86`)
- Database has `audio_recordings` table in main schema (lines 28-41 in `002_application_tables.sql:28-41`)
- Update function targets wrong table (`audio_recordings` instead of `audio_transcript`) (line 188 in `audio-recordings.ts:188`)

**Storage Configuration Issues**:
- Storage policies require `auth.uid()` but code uses email-based file paths (line 41 in `audio-recordings.ts:41`)
- Bucket policy mismatch between folder structure expectations

**Authentication Issues**:
- RLS policies on `audio_recordings` table require user authentication (lines 154-179 in `004_row_level_security.sql:154-179`)
- `audio_transcript` table has public access policies but may not exist in production

### Blockers Resolved
- ✅ Initial codebase analysis completed
- ✅ Security assessment finished
- ✅ All major audit areas covered
- ✅ Audio recording issue diagnosed

### Key Strengths Identified
- Excellent database security with RLS
- Strong input validation patterns
- Good TypeScript usage and architecture
- Modern Next.js 15 + React 19 implementation
- No dependency vulnerabilities

### Notes
- Project shows professional development practices
- Security foundation is solid but needs middleware protection
- Accessibility requires comprehensive overhaul for compliance
- Code quality is high with clear improvement paths
- Ready for production with critical fixes implemented
