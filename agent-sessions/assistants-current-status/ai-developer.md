2. **Received Implementation Guides**:
   - Component library fetching service
   - TypeScript type definitions
   - React Query hooks
   - Updated ComponentSidebar with full functionality
   - Server actions for component operations
3. **Audio Responsibilities Added**:
   - Desktop audio capture (like Loom)
   - Real-time waveform visualization
   - Audio file storage integration
   - Playback controls

## Recent Completions (Latest Session)
4. âœ… **Audio Transcription System**: 
   - Integrated Google Gemini Pro 1.5 for audio-to-text conversion
   - Implemented speaker identification with automatic labeling
   - Created structured AI summaries with bullet points for software development meetings
   - Built live transcription for preview recordings
   - Added manual transcription modal for existing recordings
   - Integrated with audio_transcript database table

5. âœ… **Build System Fixes**:

   - Fixed ESLint issues (unused variables, unescaped entities)
   - Implemented proper type definitions for AudioRecordingDB
   - Successfully completed production build

6. âœ… **Component Library Service & Integration**:
   - Built comprehensive ComponentLibraryService class with full CRUD operations
   - Implemented React Query hooks for efficient data fetching and caching
   - Created advanced ComponentSidebar with search, categories, and templates
   - Added drag-and-drop components with complexity scoring and relationships
