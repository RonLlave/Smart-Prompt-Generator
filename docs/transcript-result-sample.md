  "rawTranscript": "Speaker 1: All right. Good day. And it's already 2:25 p.m. My name is Ron Simon and the developer of this, uh, smart prompt generator that currently recording a browser window, as you can see, with in YouTube where the title have Crowd Reacts to New Battlefield 6 Trailer Plus Gameplay. So after this, uh, audio. So, I want to, uh, make to, I want for the AI summary of this, uh, audio to have a good, uh, bullet points of objective based from the, uh, YouTube, uh, recording. So yeah. So we can start now and the recording is around 14 minutes and 20 seconds. So let's start.\nSpeaker 2: I kind of wanted to watch for Battlefield 6 that I missed out on, like JackFrags, for example. I guess I should watch the official trailer first. Wait, they got a lot of stuff here. Hold on. I gotta watch all these. I missed out on so much so much stuff.\nOh, we're watching it 4K, too. 4K monitor, ladies and gentlemen.\nThere it is. Let's biscuit.\nOh.\nSorry, I just want to say scope glint. Really? We're doing scope glint?\nI saw it. I I saw it with my two eyes right there.\nThat is a crazy glint. Holy \nOh, that's cool. The ladders?\nThat reminds me of Battlebit. That's what he did in Battlebit.\nThat's the Battlebit inspiration. Or wait, no, the finals. Sorry. Not Battlebit. But they had that in Battlebit, too, I'm pretty sure.\nDamn.\nThat That actually is a really good trailer. Everybody was talking about it the past few days and I didn't get a real chance to watch it. That was cool.\nAll right. I did not see this video, though. I want to see. I'm assuming this is just explaining stuff.\nI did I did watch this, I think.\nBut whatever.\nThis does seem familiar to me.\nYeah.\nFlashbangs.\nYo, I've never seen someone use a flashbang in Battlefield. That's crazy. I only watch them blow up rooms that they're in. I've never seen a flashbang. That's crazy.\nI mean flashbangs are really good. It's just, I I more often than not, people just blow up the building that they're in.\nOh, this I don't like. You should not be able to use two primaries in a game like this. You can position yourself to have the perfect weapon in every single scenario, which kind of sucks. It's limited to shotguns, DMRs and SMGs.\nOh, so you're saying you can't have an assault rifle with a shotgun, but you can have a sniper rifle with a shotgun.\nI mean,\nI guess that's better. I don't know.\nAnyway, from what I saw, the the the amount that I watched the shotguns looked broken, genuinely. They look broken. Combined with the options to throw on an extra primary weapon makes you a formidable force that can push deep behind enemy lines.\nI really don't like that. I need to see what it looks like from a live perspective when people do high drops. I hope it's like just exaggerated in the trailer or whatever this is. Oh god, that\nI don't like that at all.\nThat is so cool. I\njust dragging bodies and like arma, for example, when you drag bodies out of combat or in cover, it's the most badass feeling\nin the world.\nWait, that seems kind of busted. Hold on.\nYo, that drops fast.\nThis looks so sick.\nSounds like a Tarkov map. What the ?\nAnd for Battlefield 6, we wanted to push destruction even further,\nboth in terms of a spectacle and as a gameplay mechanic.\nWe're debuting a new iteration called tactical destruction.\nIt gives you even more options to own the battlefield with countless ways to transform the environment.\nWhile blocking your way, try C4.\nIt does look like this game has literally zero recoil.\nIt looks like guns do not move.\nBut I don't know if that's just for this video.\nThe one thing that always confuses me about Battlefield, though, is people die in like three bullets\nand then they take like three RPGs. Like they're just immune to explosives. I swear to god. Oh, there's the maps. Oh, the portal. I saw this, actually. I saw this. Um, anyway, whenever they announced Portal, I was stoked because\nit has so much potential. And they announced it in 2042\nand it was awful. It was so bad, and it's probably still bad. And in this video, it actually looks like what Portal was supposed to be, like a truly unique way of playing the game.\nGibraltar.\nI don't know why that map looks like that. I think of Apex.\nThen there's Brooklyn.\nThis map looks the coolest, for sure.\nGibraltar's a country? Oh, really?\nI just think of Apex, man. I don't know.\nI don't know.\nAll of these maps are built to support any of our variety of modes. I watched this map. This map looked terrible.\nAnd with the return of Portal, you can also build, share, and play your custom created experiences.\nThis shit looks cool.\nThis shit looks cool.\nThat's not all. In Portal's newly redesigned verified mode, modifiers will allow players to set up hardcore rule sets with one shot kills.\nThey said the same thing last time. No, they actually this is what Portal was supposed to be. Last time, I will agree, last time, they completely deceived everybody, and they said Portal was going to be similar to this, but they didn't deliver at all what they said.\nNow they're actually showing you that they're delivering what they're saying.\nJust like GTA.\nAll right, well, that was that was the last video. So now I'm curious what Jack has to say cuz this guy's the goat.\nWhat is happening?\nYes.\nThose little numbers next to the player hits are weird. Is Are those\nAre those damage numbers? Is that what those are?\n25, 50, 75.\nThat's so weird.\nA big thanks to EA for this game looks pretty, actually. I mean, of course it looks pretty. I feel like every single one of their games has always looked good, except for 2042.\nFor example. And you can also dive onto your front. You can dive onto your back, like this.\nOoh, look at the Look at the uh tracks on the dirt. That's cool. Reload.\nTank tracks.\nThat is so sick.\nThis This This shit is so cool when when they can when when there's games that allow you to like walk or prone backwards, prone 360, aim your gun, and your whole and the whole body kind of moves. This This is really cool. It's actually really cool.\nAnd we've got the contextual lean, so if you're near a surface\nYou see that little arrow that comes up.\nThere's no manual lean in the game,\nbut you can do it. That's cool, I guess. Yeah. Right?\nI don't know. You'd have to play with that one to know if you like it.\nOh, the jets sound incredible, don't they?\nYeah, sound design sound design's always been peaked in this shit.\nWhat's up, tank?\nTry and check out that. What the ? This thing is insane.\nYes, we got it. Nice.\nYo, this thing is insane.\nI think he spawned on the point.\nCapture the objective hit.\nWait, he actually he actually couldn't control it. Hold on.\nHold on.\nRecoil check.\nCapture the objective hit.\nOh no, it's bloom, isn't it? Oh no. No, don't be bloom. That's not bloom. Yes, it is, bro. When you are shooting and your reticle is point I'm pointing at you, okay? And when your reticle is right on target, and then your bullet deviates this way, that's bloom.\nMaybe I'll push towards A.\nSo try an M4.\nTry this. What's this?\nOkay. I'm assuming there's no attachments. He I'm I'm he's probably not using attachments. I'm really banking on the fact that the gun play looks that rough because he's not using attachments. I'm really praying.\nFirst game in the bag. Wait, I want to see what this looks like, actually. I'm curious. Is it like attachments or something? I want to see what the attachments look like. Hold on.\nSo you can switch faction here on the loadout screen. You can see what your guys look like. There's not any soldier customization in the beta. And there's a few different adrenaline injector, boost speed, explosive damage, resistant to debuffs, makes enemy footsteps easier to hear.\nSo in this game, the weapon customization is completely different. Battlefield's never really done a system like this before. You essentially have a budget. See here, how it says 40 out of 100. So you have 100 points to spend. And every This is like uh Battlebit. attachment has a value. So for example, that's quite a cheap vertical grip. But if you want something that gives you a bit more control, you're going to spend 30 points. So if I put the full angled grip on there, my budget's now 70 out of 100, so I've got 30 left to spend.\nYou can also jump in the firing range and test it. See how it feels. You get the damage values there.\nThis is cool. I mean, it's pretty straightforward, but Why doesn't this gun look like it was blooming the same way? I'm confused. I think it's a I think it's attachment related. I'll be honest, cuz like when he was fighting in that first game,\ndude, the bullets were not going where it was where they were supposed to. But he didn't have a single attachment, so it has to be, it has to be attachment related. It just has to be. Look at that building though. A bit of a rubble drop. I'll try and get some rubble drop kills if I can.\nCan you get kills on rubble drops?\nSee the wire.\nThat's cool. How sick is that?\nTank coming. Put mine down.\nIs that going to hit it?\nThis mine is really cool. A motion sensor that like shoots up at this guy or whatever when it moves. That shit's so cool.\nGet it?\nOh, that was badass.\nCan I change class? Ah, can actually pick up classes now. Assault class.\nWait, you swap classes, not guns?\nWeird.\nMy class. Nice. Okay. So that's back. You can change classes. All right. I think we move on from Jack's videos here. I want to see what the jets look like.\nSo check this out. We can now free look in third person on the jet.\nSo we're going to go for a That's just easy mode, no?\nWe're taking C and B. You also now have to actually use your speed. Again, it's not like 2042.\nI love how he's yelling. He's like he's in the cockpit. He's just yelling.\nYou actually have to use your speed properly now. Okay, so we're looking for this white ring here. We're going to do a bombing run on C.\nBombs away.\nJust left the C, no targets there, though. We need some people to spot for us, ideally.\nThat thing That thing looks like it sucks ass. Does StoneMountain just do jet here, or is there? I want to see, I'm curious just like what what he feels like in a helicopter, just for funsies.\nThey got a lot of buckshot here. We're flying right over them.\nThat's cool. That's actually a cool camera angle when you go down as a chopper. Hold on. That's actually cool shit. A VTOL. Osprey Osprey. Those things. Yeah.\nThis is actually a really cool way of dying.\nThey got a lot of buckshot here. We're flying right over them.\nI when you have moments like this, when you can appreciate even dying, is what makes it super fun. Even in death, you're still having like a cool moment where you're like, that was sick. That's a cool That's a cool camera angle. Yeah, I want to see someone sniping, actually.\nOoh, it sounds good. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. Ooh. It does sound good.\nDude, this shit's going to be so insane.\nGive me thoughts on this.\nIt's going to be so Dude, it's just so it's so easy to shoot in these games. It's like people are going to hate this, I think, but the people that like sniping are going to like it. Okay, I have to download Battlefield 4. I've never played Battlefield 4. I think it's time. I think it's time.\nSpeaker 1: All right. So that is the ending of the video, and I hope the Google Gemini AI will create a good AI summary for this uh video. Nope.\nBye.",
